# AHResponsivePortfolio

For this homework assignment, I created 3 HTML pages using the bootsrap code. About Me (Index), Contact, and Portfolio. I used the bootstrap grid system to make the page responsive. For all pages, I added a nav bar, background, and favicon.
On the Contact page I included a submission form as well as links to my LinkedIn and Instagram account. I changed some of the button/hover colors on the Contact page.
On the About Me page I added an image as well as a brief paragraph about me.
I also added a sticky footer to the index.html page (although this was not very successful).
